# Superstore Data Analysis Dashboard

This project features a **Superstore Data Analytics Dashboard** built using **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly**. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of a Superstore's business performance, including sales, profit, customer behavior, and regional performance.

## Features:
1. **Raw Data Presentation**: Display the raw data of the Superstore dataset.
2. **Numerical Summary**: View descriptive statistics of the numerical columns.
3. **Filter Data by Region**: Filter the data based on different regions.
4. **Filter Data by State**: Filter the data by selecting a state.
5. **Profit and Loss by State**: Visualize the total profit and loss by state using a bar chart.
6. **Most Sold Category**: A pie chart showing the most sold product category.
7. **Most Profit by Date**: A line chart displaying the profit over time for each shipping date.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** (with **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Plotly**)
- **Superstore Dataset** (Excel file)
  
## Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdulraheem232/Superstore-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib pandas streamlit plotly
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## How It Works:

- The dashboard is built with **Streamlit**, a Python library that allows easy creation of web applications for data analysis.
- **Pandas** is used for data manipulation, such as filtering and grouping the data.
- **Plotly** is used for interactive data visualizations like pie charts, while **Matplotlib** is used for other visualizations like bar charts and line charts.

## Files:
- **app.py**: The main Streamlit application script.
- **Sample - Superstore.xls**: The Excel file containing the Superstore data.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing the necessary Python packages for the project.

## Preview:
